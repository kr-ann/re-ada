However, the term significand was introduced by George Forsythe and Cleve Moler in 1967,[7][8][9][1] and the use of mantissa for this purpose is discouraged by the IEEE floating-point standard committee[citation needed] and by some professionals such as William Kahan[3] and Donald Knuth, because it conflicts with the pre-existing use of mantissa for the fractional part of a logarithm (see also common logarithm). For instance, Knuth adopts the third representation 0.12345 × 10+3 in the example above and calls 0.12345 the fraction part of the number; he adds:[10] \"it is an abuse of terminology to call the fraction part a mantissa, since this concept has quite a different meaning in connection with logarithms\".\n",

Although the answer at https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2515477/why-is-there-no-multiple-inheritance-in-java-but-implementing-multiple-interfac is a bit outdated, the discussion following it provides some hints. It is claimed that having duplicate fields, which we could have with multiple inheritance, is much more of a problem than having duplicate methods (which we can be forced to override, as is done with the diamond problem in interfaces in Java). I'm not sure I entirely follow this line of reasoning, though, because a language could also force us to define a certain field in a subclass in case it appears multiply in superclasses.\n",

      "\"People generally don't choose Python to write fast code. The main advantages of Python are readability and simplicity. As the while loop requires the introduction of extra variables, iteration takes up more time. Thus, the while loop is quite slow and not that popular.\" This paragraph is somewhat untrue, and severely misleading to potential students learning about python.  Python isn't \"slower\" than other languages, it's just farther from the hardware.  For the purposes of beginning, intermediate, hell even advanced software engineering, Python is more than adequate in terms of the speed it runs code.  Given modern computing power available in the palms of many people's hands, let alone on their desk, in their lap, or technically in front of their TV (heck, even IN their TV), that's just not really an issue one needs to concern about, especially not in the beginning.  More importantly, having more variables doesn't necessarily make code \"slower\".  If you're going to make a statement like that, back it up with some sort of test or results.  What you SHOULD be emphasizing is that Python emphasizes iterability over lists, strings, etc., so generally, where in other programming languages you might need to iterate using a condition over an unknown amount of data, Python can simply iterate through it.  THAT is what makes while loops rarer, but still very necessary, in Python, not that while loops are \"slower\"; even if they truly were, I highly doubt the compiler wouldn't somehow help with that to the point where the difference would be difficult to discuss in terms of precision and the value of the results.\n",

Suppose you have a scheduler method that takes as an argument some base (or more likely abstract) class which may be any number of different task classes derived from that base. The scheduler invokes some method on that object. With overloading it is the method implementation in the base class that is invoked, but with overriding it is the method implemented on the actual instance class that is invoked.

The Unix Epoch (unix is an old OS btw) is also UTC 00:00:00 and was started on 1 Jan 1970. Joda time differs from UTC as it does not account for leap seconds, leap seconds are new seconds inserted into our time by an organisation called IERS, due to the slowing and imperfect rotation of earth. So far there have been 27 leap seconds.\n",

TAI International Atomic Time (backward because french) It is a weighted average of several atomic clocks (mostly caesium clocks i don't know how they work it's very complicated I think), TAI started 10 seconds ahead of UT1 and with the added leap seconds is now 37 seconds ahead.

      "For anyone looking for a simple answer for now, a dog IS-A animal, (superclass animal, subclass dog) with an animal superclass you could fill in a cat IS-A animal (horse IS-A, goat IS-A, ect). As opposed to HAS-A (called composition in OOP) like the dog HAS-A bark (cat would meow, cow would moo, ect, BTW these are just made up example methods for your animal subclasses).  A bark IS NOT an animal and is not a subclass. don't worry too much right now about understanding the HAS-A as this section is on IS-A or inheritance.  So what?   Perhaps you have a superclass of four legged animals with a finite lifespan.  You could set up a superclass with number of legs and lifespan.  Then each time you make a new four legged animal subclass for example dog (that extends animal), you will already have your legs variable and can set the lifespan then add dog specific additions like a bark() method that would apply to the dog but not to the animal.  With a little imagination you can probably think of many real life things that could be modeled in this fashion.  I hope this helps someone someday.\n",

If you create a method that only accepts an ArrayList as its parameter, then you can't use that method to accept a LinkedList even if there is no specific functionality that requires an ArrayList within the code in that method.

      "In the case of Java, a stack (ArrayDeque class) is backed by an array as an internal structure. When the stack is created, an array is created with a certain capacity (e.g. 16). When you push an element, the number of elements in the array increases from 0 to 1. However, the capacity remains fixed at 16. Now, if we keep pushing elements to the stack, it eventually becomes full (i.e., number of elements == capacity). When this happens, the stack automatically creates a bigger array (e.g. capacity of 32) and copies all of the 16 elements from the old array over. It creates a new (bigger) array because arrays in Java are non-resizable.\n",

A already went through a similar creation process of saying my value is 10, oh I see an equals sign, that means I've been assigned a spot in memory.  A will not be affected unless you work on A, like \n",
      "a = a++; or simply a++; (which is shorthand for a = a++)  Until you work on the actual spot in memory, it remains unchanged.  B is simply using A as a reference for the number 10, not changing A.  This can be confusing at first, but one of the nice things is that Java is handling this memory stuff for you, which ends up being nice (although not always for performance).  The important part is Java is pass by reference so unless you assign a value directly to a variable with the = sign, the variable won't change simply by it being \"used\" in other parts of the program.

      "I'm sorry, I messed up my terms again, too long since I used java I guess.  Yes, Java is entirely pass by value not by reference!  So when you say assign 11 to a it creates a spot in memory to grab it from and assigns that an address.  With primitives like integers, Java just grabs the value like 11 and passes that value where ever to be 'worked on' (say incremented by 1).  When you get to objects instead of grabbing a value directly it will have a value that \"points\" the way to a spot in memory.  So instead of nabbing an 11 to get 'worked on' it would grab an address (something weird like 6ae9071ex) that \"points\" to where to get the object is in memory.  So you could have multiple variables all 'pointing' to the same object which can be useful or misused.  I wouldn't worry too much about the under the hood stuff just yet, also don't put it off too long, but definitely pick up a copy of Head First into Java.  Even if it's an old version, it's explanation on how pass by value works as well as explaining the heap vs. the stack and other 'under the hood' parts of Java in such a way that even a dummy like me understood it well.  You're asking the right questions, I wish my memory was better on some of these topics, but I promise you won't regret picking up the Head First book, it will fill in some pretty important theory subjects that just aren't covered in these online courses.

      "The ideas for multi-dimensional arrays generally work the same as for lists, but now with lists instead of arrays. The more lists you put in lists the more dimensions you get. If you have a single list with non-lists inside of them, you have a 1D list. If you put a list into a list, you have a 2D list. If you put a list inside of a list inside of a list, you have a 3D list. Continuing this pattern, you'll get to higher dimensional lists:\n",

      "In this case I only put one element in each list, so it's not a very useful example, but you can add more elements to any list you wish. The elements of the types inside the lists don't have to be the same, but if you don't, it might be more difficult to work with. This holds for any dimension, but if you have a list which contain multiple types and you try to extract one, Kotlin doesn't know the precise type of the element. To avoid going into how parametric polymorphism works, it's good enough for now to go with the idea that Kotlin doesn't know the type at all. Because of this, you can't do much with the element you got, since Kotlin doesn't know what type it is. For example, you may consider putting integers and strings in your list. Then you extract an integer and want to do division on it. However, since Kotlin doesn't know the type, you can't do division, since it doesn't know it is a number. To circumvent it you'll need to know casting, which is a more advanced topic than this.\n",

      "@Andy: Here is how I understand it. If we try print(5 or 100) we get 5. If we try print(5 and 100) we get 100. According to above explanation the or/and operators are lazy, it means that only necessary and sufficient reasonings are made. It is better to illustrate it with boolean values. \"True or False\" returns True, \"True or True\" returns True - it doesn't matter which one is second operator - True or False - because OR is used. So if program see \"True or.... it can return True without even looking on  the value of the second operator. Opposingly, \"True and True\" returns True, but \"True and False\" returns False. It means, that if program see \"True and... it cannot decide whether or not the whole expression is true without looking on the second value. When considering \"5 or 100\" the logic is the same. Program sees \"5 or.... and there is no need to look at the second value because 5 is considered truthy. So it returns 5 because it is currently \"under pointer\" of the program. If program sees \"5 and 100\" it transfer the \"pointer\" from 5 to 100 because it needs to evaluate wether or not second value is truthy. As it sees 100 and 100 is truthy the program returns 100 because 100 is currently \"under pointer\".\n",

Now because of the default ending of print is \"\\n\", now a new line is created at the output waiting for the next function, let's call it <output line 2>. \n",
      "2. the 2nd print function, it reads from the last readline(3) ended, until the original text end of line, which is \"\\n\" (note \\n is counted as one character). now for this line, the first 3 characters (tho we only have one here) is \"\\n\", as the program prints \"\\n\" at output line 2, it creates a new line at the output , which become output line 3, hence the output line 2 and 3 is corresponding to the 2nd print function. now due to the default ending of 2nd print function, output line 4 is created waiting for the next function call. \n",
      "3. the 3rd print function, similar to the 1st print function, it returns and prints \"Cat\" at output line 4 and then creates a new line output line 5 due to the default ending of the print function. So the output line 4 is corresponding to the 3rd print function.\n",
      "4. the 4th print function, similar to the 2nd print function it returns 2 empty lines. So the 5th and 6th line of output are corresponding to the 4th print function.\n",

So, in an effort to control miscreants, Python makes me write ugly code in common circumstances.  But now I have to learn Python; everything else about it is fine, but the decision to force a limited view about what is clear in all contexts is, in my experience, a great flaw in the language design and forced-usage-style.\n",

I hope to forget about this soon, and just consider it as a bunch of bad syntax choices; since they are enforced, that's effectively what they are; calling it a \"style guide\" is just newspeak.
