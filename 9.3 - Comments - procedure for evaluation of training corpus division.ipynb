Length of text (4) minus length of pattern(3) gives a difference of 1, but that is the number of times you slide the pattern. It doesn't take in to account the starting position. That is you slide it once, but you make two comparisons of the pattern. Similarly if text was length 5, the difference would be 2, but you do 3 pattern comparisons. Hence the +1.\n",

As opposed to HAS-A (called composition in OOP) like the dog HAS-A bark (cat would meow, cow would moo, ect, BTW these are just made up example methods for your animal subclasses).  A bark IS NOT an animal and is not a subclass. don't worry too much right now about understanding the HAS-A as this section is on IS-A or inheritance.  So what?   Perhaps you have a superclass of four legged animals with a finite lifespan.  You could set up a superclass with number of legs and lifespan.  Then each time you make a new four legged animal subclass for example dog (that extends animal), you will already have your legs variable and can set the lifespan then add dog specific additions like a bark() method that would apply to the dog but not to the animal.  With a little imagination you can probably think of many real life things that could be modeled in this fashion.  I hope this helps someone someday.\n",

      "3 @Andy: Here is how I understand it. If we try print(5 or 100) we get 5. If we try print(5 and 100) we get 100. According to above explanation the or/and operators are lazy, it means that only necessary and sufficient reasonings are made. It is better to illustrate it with boolean values. \"True or False\" returns True, \"True or True\" returns True - it doesn't matter which one is second operator - True or False - because OR is used. So if program see \"True or.... it can return True without even looking on  the value of the second operator. Opposingly, \"True and True\" returns True, but \"True and False\" returns False. It means, that if program see \"True and... it cannot decide whether or not the whole expression is true without looking on the second value. When considering \"5 or 100\" the logic is the same. Program sees \"5 or.... and there is no need to look at the second value because 5 is considered truthy. So it returns 5 because it is currently \"under pointer\" of the program. If program sees \"5 and 100\" it transfer the \"pointer\" from 5 to 100 because it needs to evaluate wether or not second value is truthy. As it sees 100 and 100 is truthy the program returns 100 because 100 is currently \"under pointer\".\n",

If the result can't be computed by reading the first operand alone, it looks at the second one. In this case, the second operand always has the same logigal value as the expression (say 0.0 or False).
