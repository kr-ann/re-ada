      "\"People generally don't choose Python to write fast code. The main advantages of Python are readability and simplicity. As the while loop requires the introduction of extra variables, iteration takes up more time. Thus, the while loop is quite slow and not that popular.\" This paragraph is somewhat untrue, and severely misleading to potential students learning about python.  Python isn't \"slower\" than other languages, it's just farther from the hardware.  For the purposes of beginning, intermediate, hell even advanced software engineering, Python is more than adequate in terms of the speed it runs code.  Given modern computing power available in the palms of many people's hands, let alone on their desk, in their lap, or technically in front of their TV (heck, even IN their TV), that's just not really an issue one needs to concern about, especially not in the beginning.  More importantly, having more variables doesn't necessarily make code \"slower\".  If you're going to make a statement like that, back it up with some sort of test or results.  What you SHOULD be emphasizing is that Python emphasizes iterability over lists, strings, etc., so generally, where in other programming languages you might need to iterate using a condition over an unknown amount of data, Python can simply iterate through it.  THAT is what makes while loops rarer, but still very necessary, in Python, not that while loops are \"slower\"; even if they truly were, I highly doubt the compiler wouldn't somehow help with that to the point where the difference would be difficult to discuss in terms of precision and the value of the results.\n",
